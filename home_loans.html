                <!-- <h3 class="hny-title">Dreams into Reality!</h3> -->
                <p class="py-3">A Home Loan is a secured loan product where the lender provides finances for the purchase or construction of a residential/commercial property. One can also avail a housing loan to buy a plot of land and construct on it. Home Loans are also issued to extend/ repair/ renovate/ alter a new or second-hand property. The Home Loan is taken by a borrower against the property/security to be bought. This is done by giving the banker a conditional ownership over the property i.e. if the borrower fails to pay back the loan, the banker can retrieve the lent money by selling the property.
<br><br>
Most lenders get the property valued independently and provide loans based on their estimated value. 
It is important to remember, however, that frequently their valuation is significantly lower than the actual
 cost and hence the requirement of the borrowers goes up. Home loans in Indian Banks are provided up to maximum of 80% 
 (90% for loan amount below INR 20 lakhs) of the value of the house. Home loans are repaid using Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs) 
 spread over a fixed tenure.

                <!-- <h3 class="hny-title">Dreams into Reality!</h3> -->
                <p class="py-3">Home Loan eligibility depends upon various factors. A few of them are listed here –
				<br>
				<b>Income –</b> Your income determines the amount of home loan you are eligible for. Banks generally keep the EMI to income ratio at 0.45 to 0.50.
<br>
<b>Tenure –</b> The longer tenure you opt for, the more is your home loan eligibility and the lesser is your EMI.
<br>
<b>Age –</b> Your age will determine your home loan tenure and hence your eligibility.
<br>
<b>Interest Rate offered –</b> Banks offer Fixed and Floating Rates of Interest. If your interest rates are on a lower side, then the loan eligibility will be higher..
<br>
<b>CIBIL Score –</b> Your credit report tells the bank about your repayment capacity and hence determines if you’re eligible for a loan.

				<h6 class="sub-title">Home Loan Interest Rates:</h6>
                <!-- <h3 class="hny-title">Dreams into Reality!</h3> -->
                <p class="py-3">Home Loan in India can primarily be classified into two based on interest rates: fixed rate and floating rate of interest.
				</p>
				<hr style="background-color:white">
				<h6 class="sub-title">Home Loan – Fixed Interest Rate:</h6>
                <!-- <h3 class="hny-title">Dreams into Reality!</h3> -->
                <p class="py-3">Fixed interest rate refers to repayment of home loans in fixed equal instalments over the entire period of the loan. In this case, the interest rate doesn’t change with market fluctuations.
<br><br>
During the early part of the tenure, the monthly payments are used to service the interest and the principal is served in the later parts of the tenure. Very few lenders in India offer pure fixed rates where the rate of interest remains constant over the entire tenure. Most lenders have a reset clause of 3-5 years. If the borrower is certain that the rate of interest is the lowest in the market, only then should he opt for fixed rates of interest.
Floating interest rate implies that the rate of interest will vary vary with market conditions. Home loans on floating interest rates are tied to a base rate plus a floating element thereof. So, if the base rate varies, the floating interest rate also varies.
<br><br>
The interest rates will depend on the base rate of the bank. As and when the bank changes their base rate, the interest rate changes. The change can either be in terms of the EMI or the tenure. For example, if the bank increases their base rate, the customer could choose to increase his EMI or to increase his tenure. Or if the bank decides to decrease their base rate, the customer can reduce his EMI or his tenure.
In recent times, some lenders have come up with innovative home loan products like dual rate of interest. This is where the interest rate on loans remains fixed for initial 1-5 years and thereafter switches to a floating rate of interest.
<br><br>
But, it is up to the borrower to decide what suits him best. Before taking a decision, it is advisable to compare home loans from different lenders in detail.
<br><br>
If you are thinking of buying a home and are looking at loan products, look no further. At axisfinancialservice.com, we help you get the best deals on loans. View our EMI Calculator which will help you calculate how much EMI is payable every month.
<br><br>
Your EMI depends upon the interest rate which the bank charges you, the tenure of the loan as well as the loan amount. You can also alter the tenure and the interest rates to see how you can reduce the EMI or the tenure of loan.

				<h6 class="sub-title">Applying for a New Home Loan</h6>
                <!-- <h3 class="hny-title">Dreams into Reality!</h3> -->
                <p class="py-3">Buying a home is a dream come true for many of us. Rising interest rates are making it a rather expensive affair. Once you finalize on your property, 80% of the amount can be taken as a loan from a bank depending upon how much loan you are eligible for.
<br><br>
Home loans can be repaid to the bank every month as equated monthly instalments over the entire tenure of the loan. A part of this EMI goes towards repaying the principal component of the loan and the other part goes towards paying the interest.
<br><br>
The EMI is calculated on a reducing balance basis. A reducing balance loan means that in the initial days of the loan, the interest component of the EMI is high. But gradually, as you keep on paying more EMIs, the interest component of the EMI goes down and the principal component increases towards the end of the tenure.
<br><br>
Also, while you are going to take a home loan you need to decide, the type of interest rate you want to pay to the bank. The banks will offer you with an option of a fixed rate or a floating rate. Generally the floating interest rates are cheaper compared to the fixed rates.

                <!-- <h3 class="hny-title">Dreams into Reality!</h3> -->
                <p class="py-3">Buying a home is dream for many and one should be cautious while looking out for a home loan lenders. 
				The foremost thing to be kept in mind is that one should never finalize a lender purely on the basis of interest rates. 
				Most of us believe the cheapest is the best. But actually, in addition to this, there are other things that should be kept 
				in mind while finalizing home loans.

				<h6 class="sub-title">Consider Home Loan Eligibility Factors</h6>
                <!-- <h3 class="hny-title">Dreams into Reality!</h3> -->
                <p class="py-3">Banks have their own standards for calculating eligibility. 
				Factors like age, annual income and loan tenures play an important role. 
				You should do some shopping to check which bank is offering you a higher loan eligibility. 
				Adding up your spouse’s income may be a good option to increase your eligibility.

				<h6 class="sub-title">Home Loan Fixed or Floating Interest Rate</h6>
                <!-- <h3 class="hny-title">Dreams into Reality!</h3> -->
                <p class="py-3">A fixed interest rate means that you will have to pay same EMI over a period of time
				(it may be fixed for an entire tenure or it may be reset at fixed intervals). 
				Floating interest rates may change at any given point of time, which may result increase or decrease in 
				either your home loan EMI or your tenure. 
				Consider your finances and repayment abilities before deciding on which interest rate to pick.

				<h6 class="sub-title">Existing Home Loan Customers:</h6>
                <!-- <h3 class="hny-title">Dreams into Reality!</h3> -->
                <p class="py-3">Many existing home loan customers are coughing up high interest rates. If you’re amongst them, 
				you should consider shifting your home loan from your existing lender to a new one. This facility is called a 
				‘balance transfer option’ and many banks offer this facility nowadays. 
				Doing so will decrease the monthly EMI you are paying towards your loan and will bring in savings.
				
				<br><br><b>If You Want To Save Money On Your Home Loan, Apply For A Home Loan Balance Transfer Right Here!</b><br><br>
				You should also consider shifting from the old BPLR system, where the interest rate constantly changes, to the new base rate system. 
				This is more transparent than the previous one and ensures you don’t end up paying more unnecessarily.
